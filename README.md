## Project insights
-Classic category contributes to maximum sales and total orders. <br />
-Large size Pizza contributes to maximum sales up to 46% approx. <br />
-Orders are highest on weekends. <br />
-There are maximum orders from month of July and January.

## Final conclusion
To increase the Pizzas sale, we need to make Classic category Pizzas more than other categories and focused on large size Pizzas. On weekends we can give great offers to customers, it can help to increase orders.
